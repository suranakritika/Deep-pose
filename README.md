# DeepPose: Human Pose Estimation via Deep Neural Networks

DeepPose Paper : https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4659

**Note : This is not the Original Implementation, still there's lot of work pending.**

In the repository, I have just tried to implement the model and just tried to load the matlab files. I am still working on the preprocessing of data and fine tuning the parameters.

**model.ipynb** : Model Implementation
**dataset_helper** : Converted the .mat coordinates to csv and transposed the coordinates
